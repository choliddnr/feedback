# Feedback App

## What is this?

This is a simple app built to collect customer feedback about products.

## Why did I create this app?

Initially, I created this app to gather feedback from my own customers. My goal was to keep it as simple as possible to ship quickly. However, as I worked on it, I realized the potential to turn it into a SaaS product. That‚Äôs when I began exploring different architectures and tech stacks to find the best fit for my goals.

## Architecture & Tech Stack

At first, I used **PocketBase** as the backend. It offers out-of-the-box features like a database, storage, and authentication, making it easy to get started quickly. I paired it with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) and [Nitro](https://nitro.build/), using Nitro as a Backend For Frontend (BFF). At that point, it seemed like all I needed.

Later, I reconsidered the deployment strategy. Deploying PocketBase and Nuxt separately didn‚Äôt feel efficient. So, I decided to remove PocketBase and instead implement all core services directly within Nitro. Here's what I used:

1.  [SQLite](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3) ‚Äì A lightweight, file-based relational database that fits this project well.
2.  [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) ‚Äì Since SQLite may become less performant as the user base grows, I wanted an ORM to abstract the database and make migrations easier. I considered both Prisma and Drizzle (I've used both before) and found Drizzle more suitable for this project.
3.  [unstorage ](https://unstorage.unjs.io/) ‚Äì Since I'm using Nuxt, I was already familiar with the UnJS ecosystem. `unstorage` was a natural fit for handling storage.
4.  [better-auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) ‚Äì For now, this library provides the best balance of flexibility and simplicity for authentication.

## Deployment

For the demo, I deployed the app on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) (a free hosting platform). Due to its limitations, I had to make a few adjustments:

1. Switched to [Cloudflare D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/) for the database and implemented custom "transaction-like" logic, as D1 doesn‚Äôt support real transactions yet.
2. Used [Bunny.net](https://bunny.net/) for external file storage, which provides a performant and affordable solution.

## What‚Äôs Next?

There‚Äôs still plenty of room for improvement:

- Add unit and end-to-end testing to improve maintainability
- Refactor parts of the codebase to improve reusability
- Build and ship additional features like response analysis and better dashboard tools

## Key Features

- Support for multiple merchants and products
- Social login
- Ability to ask customers for ratings
- Clean dashboard interface
- (More features coming soon‚Ä¶)

## Challenges I Faced

- Replacing PocketBase‚Äôs full suite of features with minimal tools while maintaining simplicity
- Implementing transaction-like behavior in Cloudflare D1
- Handling file uploads and ensuring compatibility with Cloudflare Pages

## Notes

- **Call an API endpoint from another api endpoint**: Unexpected behavior when calling an api endpoint to another endpoint on wrangler dev or Cloudflare-Pages platform. It's return server error 500.
